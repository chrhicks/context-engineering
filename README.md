# Context Engineering: Structured Patterns for Better AI Workflows

I was getting inconsistent results from AI agents, so I started systematically testing different approaches. Here are some patterns that helped me get more reliable outcomes. Maybe they'll help you too.

## What This Is

A collection of templates, patterns, and approaches for working more effectively with AI agents. Everything here came from experimenting with different ways to structure tasks, manage context, and get more predictable results.

The whole project was developed collaboratively with AI agents using specialized roles - so it's AI helping humans work better with AI.

## Quick Start

**Try this first**: Use the [Enhanced Planning Template](./templates/planning-template.json) for your next complex AI task. It provides structure for breaking down problems and managing context.

**If you're getting inconsistent AI results**: Check out the [Context Patterns Guide](./guides/context-patterns.md) - you might recognize some of these issues.

**Want examples**: Look at the [Examples](./examples/) folder for before/after comparisons.

## What's Here

### Templates & Tools
- **[Planning Template](./templates/planning-template.json)** - Structured approach to complex AI tasks
- **[Agent Prompts](./templates/agent-prompts/)** - Specialized prompts for different types of work
- **[Quick Reference](./guides/quick-reference.md)** - Essential patterns and checklists

### Guides & Patterns
- **[Context Patterns](./guides/context-patterns.md)** - Common issues and solutions
- **[Getting Started](./guides/getting-started.md)** - Step-by-step introduction
- **[Quick Reference](./guides/quick-reference.md)** - Essential patterns and checklists

### Examples
- **[Before/After](./examples/)** - Real examples showing improvements
- **[Use Cases](./examples/use-cases/)** - Different scenarios and approaches

## The Story

This started as a personal learning project. I wanted to understand why some AI interactions worked great while others were frustrating. Through systematic experimentation (with help from AI agents playing different research roles), I discovered some patterns that consistently improved results.

The "research" here isn't academic - it's practical experimentation with what works and what doesn't. The goal is sharing useful patterns, not proving theories.

## Community

This is meant to be collaborative. If you try these patterns and find improvements, variations, or completely different approaches that work better, please share them.

**Ways to contribute:**
- Try the templates and share your results
- Suggest improvements or variations
- Share your own patterns that work well
- Help make the documentation clearer

## Getting Started

1. **Pick a current AI workflow that's frustrating you**
2. **Try the [Enhanced Planning Template](./templates/planning-template.json)** on your next complex task
3. **See if the structured approach helps**
4. **Share what you learn**

The best way to understand this stuff is to try it on real work.

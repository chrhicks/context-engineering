# Specialized Template Experiments

These are experimental variations of the main planning template, focused on specific domains. They came from AI agent experiments exploring whether more targeted templates might be useful for different types of work.

## What These Are

During our AI research experiments, we tried creating templates that focused on specific areas:

- **Backend Development**: Template focused on database design, API architecture, and performance
- **Security-Focused**: Template emphasizing threat modeling, compliance, and security architecture  
- **Medium Complexity**: Balanced template for general full-stack development

## Experimental Status

These templates represent patterns that emerged from AI agent experiments. They're not "production-ready" - they're experimental approaches that might be useful starting points for your own template development.

**Important**: These haven't been tested extensively in real-world scenarios. If you try them, please share what works and what doesn't.

## How to Use

1. **Start with the main [planning template](../planning-template.json)** to understand the basic approach
2. **Try one of these specialized versions** if it matches your domain
3. **Adapt and modify** based on what works for your specific use case
4. **Share your results** - what worked, what didn't, what you changed

## Template Descriptions

### Backend Developer Template
Focuses on database design, API architecture, and performance optimization. Includes structured approaches for:
- Database schema planning with performance considerations
- API design with security and scalability in mind
- Performance optimization checkpoints

### Security-Focused Template  
Emphasizes security architecture, threat modeling, and compliance. Includes frameworks for:
- Systematic threat modeling (STRIDE analysis)
- Compliance requirement mapping (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
- Security control validation

### Medium Complexity Template
Balanced approach for full-stack projects. Covers:
- Frontend and backend considerations equally
- Integration and deployment planning
- Quality assurance across all layers

## Contributing

If you try these templates:
- Share what worked well and what didn't
- Suggest improvements or variations
- Create your own domain-specific templates
- Help us understand which patterns are actually useful

Remember: these are experimental starting points, not finished solutions.

# Agent Prompts

*Specialized prompts for different types of Context Engineering work*

## Coming Soon

This section will contain specialized agent prompts for:
- Research and analysis tasks
- Planning and coordination work  
- Validation and review processes
- Domain-specific implementations

## Current Status

We're still developing these specialized prompts based on community feedback and real-world usage patterns. 

**Want to contribute?** If you've developed effective agent prompts using Context Engineering patterns, we'd love to include them here. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to share.

## In the Meantime

The [planning template](../planning-template.json) includes agent strategy sections that show how to structure multi-agent approaches for complex tasks.

For immediate use, focus on:
- The main [planning template](../planning-template.json)
- [Context patterns guide](../../guides/context-patterns.md) for common issues
- [Examples](../../examples/) showing different approaches in action

# Contributing to Context Engineering

Thanks for your interest in improving these patterns! This project is all about sharing what works in practice, so your real-world experiences are incredibly valuable.

## Ways to Contribute

### üß™ Try the Patterns and Share Results
The most helpful contribution is using these patterns on real work and sharing how it goes.

**What's useful to share:**
- Which patterns you tried
- What type of task you used them on
- What worked well vs. what didn't
- Any improvements or variations you discovered

**How to share:**
- Open a [GitHub Discussion](../../discussions) to share your experience
- Create an issue if you found problems or have suggestions
- Submit a pull request if you want to add examples or improvements

### üìù Add Examples
Real examples help everyone understand how to apply these patterns.

**Good examples include:**
- Before/after comparisons showing specific improvements
- Different domains (coding, writing, analysis, planning)
- Both successes and failures (what didn't work and why)
- Adaptations for specific use cases

### üîß Improve Documentation
Help make the guides clearer and more useful.

**Areas that often need work:**
- Clarifying confusing explanations
- Adding missing steps or context
- Fixing typos or broken links
- Improving organization and navigation

### üí° Suggest New Patterns
If you discover patterns that work well, share them!

**What makes a good pattern:**
- Addresses a common problem with AI workflows
- Has clear, actionable steps
- You've tested it on real tasks
- Others could apply it to their work

## How to Submit Contributions

### For Discussions and Feedback
- Use [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions) for sharing experiences and asking questions
- Use [Issues](../../issues) for specific problems or suggestions

### For Code/Documentation Changes
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Make your improvements
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description

**Pull request tips:**
- Explain what you're changing and why
- Keep changes focused (one improvement per PR)
- Follow the existing style and tone
- Test any examples you add

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone
- **Conversational and practical** - like explaining to a colleague
- **Honest about limitations** - what doesn't work is as important as what does
- **Focused on real problems** - avoid theoretical examples

### Structure
- **Start with the problem** - why does this matter?
- **Show before/after** - concrete improvements are convincing
- **Include validation** - how do you know it's working?
- **Be specific** - vague advice isn't actionable

### Examples
- **Use realistic scenarios** - actual tasks people do
- **Show the messy parts** - real work isn't perfect
- **Include failure cases** - when patterns don't help

## Community Guidelines

### Be Helpful
- Share what actually worked for you
- Be honest about what didn't work
- Help others understand how to apply patterns

### Be Respectful
- Everyone's trying to improve their AI workflows
- Different approaches work for different people
- Constructive feedback is always welcome

### Be Practical
- Focus on patterns that solve real problems
- Share concrete examples over theoretical discussions
- Test suggestions before recommending them

## Questions?

- **General questions**: Use [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions)
- **Specific issues**: Create an [Issue](../../issues)
- **Want to chat**: Mention @chrhicks in discussions

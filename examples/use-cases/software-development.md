# Software Development Use Cases

*How Context Engineering patterns apply to common development tasks*

## When Context Engineering Helps Most

### ✅ **High-Value Scenarios**
- **Complex implementations** - Multi-step features with dependencies
- **Architecture decisions** - When approach matters for long-term maintainability  
- **Debugging complex issues** - Multiple potential causes, need systematic investigation
- **Code reviews and refactoring** - Understanding existing code and planning improvements
- **Integration work** - Connecting different systems or services

### ❌ **Lower-Value Scenarios**
- **Simple syntax questions** - "How do I loop through an array in JavaScript?"
- **Quick documentation lookups** - "What parameters does this API take?"
- **Straightforward bug fixes** - Clear error message with obvious solution

## Common Development Patterns

### 1. Feature Implementation

**Template:**
```
Context:
- Existing codebase: [tech stack, architecture patterns]
- Feature requirements: [what needs to be built]
- Constraints: [performance, compatibility, timeline]

Approach:
- Phase 1: Design and plan implementation
- Phase 2: Core functionality
- Phase 3: Integration and testing

Validation:
- Design review before coding
- Functionality testing after core implementation
- Integration testing before completion
```

**Example:** Building a real-time notification system
- Phase 1: Choose WebSocket vs. Server-Sent Events, design message flow
- Phase 2: Implement backend notification service and frontend handlers
- Phase 3: Integrate with existing user management, add error handling

### 2. Code Architecture Review

**Template:**
```
Context:
- Current architecture: [describe existing structure]
- Problems: [performance, maintainability, scalability issues]
- Goals: [what good architecture would achieve]

Analysis approach:
- Phase 1: Identify architectural pain points
- Phase 2: Evaluate alternative approaches
- Phase 3: Plan migration strategy

Validation:
- Confirm problem analysis before solutions
- Validate approach feasibility before planning
- Review migration plan for risks
```

**Example:** Refactoring monolithic API to microservices
- Phase 1: Identify service boundaries and coupling issues
- Phase 2: Design service interfaces and data flow
- Phase 3: Plan gradual extraction strategy

### 3. Performance Investigation

**Template:**
```
Context:
- Performance problem: [specific symptoms, measurements]
- System architecture: [components, data flow]
- Recent changes: [what might have caused issues]

Investigation strategy:
- Phase 1: Isolate bottleneck layer (frontend/backend/database)
- Phase 2: Deep dive into identified layer
- Phase 3: Implement and validate solution

Validation:
- Confirm bottleneck before deep investigation
- Test solution in staging before production
- Measure improvement against baseline
```

**Example:** Database query optimization
- Phase 1: Identify slow queries using monitoring tools
- Phase 2: Analyze query execution plans and index usage
- Phase 3: Implement optimizations and measure improvements

## Development-Specific Context Patterns

### Tech Stack Context
Always include your specific technologies:
```
Tech stack: React 18, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, Redis
Deployment: Docker containers on AWS ECS
Monitoring: DataDog for APM, Sentry for errors
```

### Codebase Context
Help AI understand your existing patterns:
```
Architecture: Clean architecture with service layer
Patterns: Repository pattern for data access, dependency injection
Testing: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E
Code style: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint + Prettier
```

### Constraint Context
Be explicit about limitations:
```
Constraints:
- Must maintain backward compatibility with v1 API
- Cannot introduce breaking changes to database schema
- Performance budget: <200ms API response time
- Security: Must pass OWASP security scan
```

## Validation Patterns for Development

### Code Quality Checkpoints
- **Design phase**: "Does this approach fit our architecture patterns?"
- **Implementation phase**: "Does this code follow our style guidelines?"
- **Integration phase**: "Do all tests pass and performance meet requirements?"

### Technical Decision Validation
- **Confidence check**: "Rate your confidence in this technical approach (1-10)"
- **Risk assessment**: "What could go wrong with this implementation?"
- **Alternative evaluation**: "What other approaches did you consider and why reject them?"

## Common Development Anti-Patterns

### ❌ **Jumping to Code Too Quickly**
**Problem:** Starting implementation without understanding requirements or constraints  
**Solution:** Always include design/planning phase with validation

### ❌ **Generic Solutions**
**Problem:** AI provides boilerplate code that doesn't fit your specific setup  
**Solution:** Include detailed tech stack and architecture context

### ❌ **No Testing Strategy**
**Problem:** Implementation without considering how to validate it works  
**Solution:** Include testing approach in planning phase

### ❌ **Ignoring Existing Patterns**
**Problem:** New code doesn't follow established codebase conventions  
**Solution:** Include existing patterns and style guidelines in context

## Success Metrics for Development Tasks

### Immediate Indicators
- **First attempt success rate** - How often does the initial solution work?
- **Context relevance** - Does AI understand your specific tech stack?
- **Pattern consistency** - Does generated code match your existing style?

### Longer-term Benefits
- **Reduced debugging time** - Fewer issues from poorly planned implementations
- **Better architecture decisions** - More systematic evaluation of alternatives
- **Improved code quality** - Consistent patterns and better error handling

## Tips for Development Context Engineering

1. **Be specific about your stack** - "React" vs "React 18 with TypeScript and Vite"
2. **Include existing patterns** - Show how similar problems are solved in your codebase
3. **Specify quality requirements** - Performance, security, maintainability goals
4. **Plan for testing** - How you'll validate the implementation works
5. **Consider integration** - How new code fits with existing systems

The goal is getting AI to work like a senior developer who understands your codebase, constraints, and quality standards.

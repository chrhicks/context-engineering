# Examples

This folder contains before/after examples showing how Context Engineering patterns improve AI workflows.

## What's Here

### Before/After Comparisons
- **[Simple Task](./simple-task-example.md)** - Basic request vs. structured approach
- **[Complex Project](./complex-project-example.md)** - Multi-phase work with validation
- **[Debugging Session](./debugging-example.md)** - Troubleshooting with context management

### Use Cases
- **[Software Development](./use-cases/software-development.md)** - Code, architecture, debugging
- **[Content Creation](./use-cases/content-creation.md)** - Writing, editing, research
- **[Data Analysis](./use-cases/data-analysis.md)** - Research, visualization, insights
- **[Project Planning](./use-cases/project-planning.md)** - Strategy, coordination, execution

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Read the "Before" version** - notice common problems
2. **Compare with "After" version** - see how structure helps
3. **Try the pattern** on your own similar tasks
4. **Adapt the approach** to fit your specific needs

## Contributing Examples

If you try these patterns and get interesting results, please share! Good examples help everyone understand how to apply these concepts.

**What makes a good example:**
- Real task you actually needed to do
- Clear before/after comparison
- Specific improvements you noticed
- Honest about what didn't work

## Common Patterns Across Examples

You'll notice these themes:
- **Clear context setup** - AI understands the task before starting
- **Phase-based approach** - complex work broken into manageable chunks
- **Validation checkpoints** - regular check-ins prevent drift
- **Focused information** - relevant context only, not everything

The goal is showing practical application, not perfect theoretical examples.

# Agent Squad Integration Guide

*How to apply Context Engineering patterns to improve agent squad consistency*

## The Challenge

Agent squads can produce inconsistent results when:
- Agents work with different context or assumptions
- Information gets corrupted as it passes between agents
- Roles overlap or have gaps in coverage
- No systematic validation between agent outputs

## Context Engineering Solutions

### 1. Master/Child Delegation for Agent Squads

**Pattern**: Designate one "master" agent for coordination, others as "specialist" agents

```
Master Agent Role:
- Maintains overall context and objectives
- Coordinates between specialist agents
- Validates consistency across outputs
- Makes final integration decisions

Specialist Agent Roles:
- Focus on specific domain expertise
- Work with isolated, relevant context
- Report back to master with structured outputs
- Avoid making decisions outside their domain
```

### 2. Structured Handoff Protocols

**Problem**: Context gets corrupted when passing between agents

**Solution**: Explicit handoff templates
```
Agent Handoff Template:
- Completed work: [What was accomplished]
- Key decisions: [Important choices made and rationale]
- Context for next agent: [Essential information to continue]
- Validation checkpoints: [How to verify this work is correct]
- Open questions: [What needs clarification]
```

### 3. Context Isolation Between Agents

**Pattern**: Prevent one agent's errors from spreading to others

```
Isolation Strategy:
- Each agent gets only relevant context for their task
- Intermediate reasoning stays with the originating agent
- Only validated outputs get shared
- Master agent monitors for contradictions
```

## Quick Start for Agent Squad

### Phase 1: Baseline Measurement (Week 1)
Track current inconsistency issues:
- How often do agents contradict each other?
- Where do errors typically occur in the workflow?
- What causes the most rework or confusion?

### Phase 2: Apply Context Engineering (Week 2-3)

**Step 1: Define Clear Roles**
```
Master Agent: "You coordinate the overall task and ensure consistency"
Research Agent: "You gather and analyze information, report findings"
Implementation Agent: "You execute based on validated plans"
Validation Agent: "You check work quality and catch errors"
```

**Step 2: Implement Handoff Protocols**
- Agents must confirm understanding before starting
- Structured output format for passing work
- Validation checkpoints between major handoffs

**Step 3: Context Management**
- Master agent maintains overall context
- Specialist agents get focused, relevant context only
- Regular context health checks to prevent pollution

### Phase 3: Measure Improvements (Week 4)
Compare to baseline:
- Reduction in contradictions between agents
- Fewer instances of rework or confusion
- Improved overall output quality and consistency

## Common Agent Squad Anti-Patterns

### ❌ **Context Pollution Spread**
**Problem**: One agent's hallucination spreads to others
**Solution**: Validate outputs before sharing, isolate reasoning

### ❌ **Role Confusion**
**Problem**: Agents step outside their expertise or overlap work
**Solution**: Clear role definitions with explicit boundaries

### ❌ **Information Overload**
**Problem**: All agents get all context, leading to confusion
**Solution**: Relevant context only, master agent coordinates

### ❌ **No Validation Between Steps**
**Problem**: Errors compound as work passes between agents
**Solution**: Validation checkpoints at each handoff

## Agent Squad Template

```json
{
  "agent_squad_coordination": {
    "master_agent": {
      "role": "Overall coordination and consistency validation",
      "responsibilities": [
        "Maintain project context and objectives",
        "Coordinate between specialist agents", 
        "Validate consistency across outputs",
        "Make final integration decisions"
      ],
      "context_access": "Full project context"
    },
    "specialist_agents": [
      {
        "role": "Research Agent",
        "responsibilities": ["Information gathering", "Analysis", "Findings summary"],
        "context_access": "Research-relevant context only",
        "handoff_format": "Structured findings with confidence levels"
      },
      {
        "role": "Implementation Agent", 
        "responsibilities": ["Execute validated plans", "Technical implementation"],
        "context_access": "Implementation-relevant context only",
        "handoff_format": "Completed work with validation criteria"
      }
    ],
    "validation_checkpoints": [
      {
        "trigger": "Before specialist agent starts work",
        "check": "Agent confirms understanding of task and context"
      },
      {
        "trigger": "Before handoff to next agent",
        "check": "Output meets quality criteria and format requirements"
      },
      {
        "trigger": "Before final integration",
        "check": "No contradictions between agent outputs"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Success Indicators

**Week 1-2**: Agents follow role boundaries more consistently
**Week 3-4**: Fewer contradictions and rework cycles  
**Month 1**: Predictable, high-quality outputs from agent squad

## Troubleshooting

**If agents still contradict each other:**
- Tighten role definitions and context isolation
- Add more validation checkpoints
- Check if master agent is effectively coordinating

**If workflow becomes too rigid:**
- Simplify handoff protocols
- Focus on highest-impact validation points
- Allow flexibility within role boundaries

**If agents seem confused about their roles:**
- Make role definitions more explicit
- Provide examples of good vs. poor role execution
- Add confidence checks ("How confident are you in your role understanding?")

## Next Steps

1. **Try the basic pattern** with your current agent squad setup
2. **Track specific improvements** vs. current inconsistency issues
3. **Share results** - what worked, what didn't, what surprised you
4. **Iterate based on learnings** - adapt patterns to your specific use case

This is experimental - we're learning together how Context Engineering applies to agent squads. Your real-world testing will help improve these patterns for everyone.

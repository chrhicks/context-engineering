# Template History

This directory contains the historical template versions that led to the current experimental templates.

## Template Evolution

### planning-template-v2.md
**Version 2.0** - Introduced context management and failure mode prevention
- Context Engineering Strategy with budget management
- Four failure mode prevention (Poisoning, Distraction, Confusion, Clash)
- Master/child delegation patterns
- Dynamic context loading strategies
- Comprehensive validation framework

### 02-enhanced-planning-template-v3.json
**Version 3.0** - Empirically validated integration framework
- Complexity assessment with quantified indicators
- Adaptive execution strategy based on task complexity
- Integration of experimental findings with expected outcomes
- Synergistic template + delegation coordination
- Context engineering optimization strategies

## How These Led to Current Templates

These historical versions represent the experimental progression that led to the current specialized templates:

1. **v2** solved context pollution and agent coordination problems
2. **v3** achieved breakthrough quality through systematic approach selection
3. **Current specialized templates** optimize for efficiency while maintaining v3's quality benefits

See [Template Evolution](../template-evolution.md) for the complete story of how these templates developed through AI agent experimentation.
